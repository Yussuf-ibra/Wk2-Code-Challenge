Interactive Shopping List is a web application that allows users to manage their shopping lists. Users can add items, mark them as purchased, edit items, and clear the list. The list is saved using local storage, so it persists even after the page reloads.

## Requirements

- *Array*: Maintain a JavaScript array to store shopping list items.
- *DOM Manipulation*: Create an HTML structure with an input field for adding items, a list container to display items, and buttons for "Add" and "Clear List".
  - Dynamically add new items to the list container when the user clicks the "Add" button. (The new items do not have to be persisted once the page refreshes)
  - Update the list item visually to indicate purchased items (e.g., strikethrough text, different background color).
- *Event Handling*:
  - Attach event listeners to the "Add" button to capture user input and add items to the list.
  - Attach event listeners to the list of items to allow users to mark them as purchased.
  - Attach an event listener to the "Clear List" button to remove all items from the list.

## Project Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    bash
    git clone https://github.com/Yussuf-ibra/Wk2-Code-Challenge.git
    
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    bash
    cd WIK2
    
3. Open index.html in your web browser to see the app.

## Usage

1. Enter an item in the input field and click the "Add" button to add it to the shopping list.
2. Click on an item to mark it as purchased (the item will be crossed out and have a different background color).
3. Double-click an item to edit its name.
4. Click the "Clear List" button to remove all items from the list.
5. The list is saved in local storage, so it will persist even after the page is reloaded.
